Hi  Rowan,

I hope youâ€™re doing well!

I have a couple of questions about our next class. Firstly, could you please confirm the topics we will be covering? Additionally, will there be any specific materials or resources we need to review beforehand?

Also, I wanted to let you know that I have attached my homework for this week to this email. Please let me know if you have any trouble accessing the file.

Thank you and looking forward to your response!

Best regards,
Serhii.
